## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Responsive Design

EduTracker is designed mobile-first and adapts to any screen size. All pages and components (dashboard, attendance, schedule, todo, activity, profile, auth, etc.) are fully responsive:
- Controls and cards stack vertically on small screens
- Touch targets and font sizes are optimized for mobile
- Grids and tables scroll horizontally if needed
- No horizontal overflow or squished content

## Theming

EduTracker uses a CSS variable-based theme system. You can switch between light and dark themes (and add more if desired). All colors, backgrounds, borders, and UI states are controlled by semantic tokens:

- `--bg`, `--bg-light`, `--bg-dark`: backgrounds
- `--text`, `--text-muted`: text colors
- `--primary`, `--danger`, `--success`, etc.: semantic accents
- `--btn-bg`, `--btn-text`: button colors
- ...and more (see table below)

To add or customize a theme, edit the CSS variables in `globals.css` or your theme provider.
